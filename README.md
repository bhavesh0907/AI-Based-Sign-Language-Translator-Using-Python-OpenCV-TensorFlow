# AI-Based Sign Language Translator

## Overview
The **AI-Based Sign Language Translator** utilizes deep learning and computer vision to recognize sign language gestures and translate them into text or speech in real time. It employs OpenCV for gesture detection and TensorFlow for model training, improving accessibility for the hearing impaired.

## Features
- 🖐 **Real-Time Gesture Recognition** – Detects and translates sign language gestures instantly.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Translation** – Uses deep learning models for accurate interpretation.
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Integration** – Converts translated text into spoken words.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface** – Interactive UI for ease of use.
- 🌍 **Multi-Language Support** – Supports multiple languages for broader accessibility.
